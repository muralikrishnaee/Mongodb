Replication Procedure for PSS:

* Start the servers
start /b mongod --replSet rs --dbpath rs1 --port 37017 --logpath logs\rs1.log --logappend 
start /b mongod --replSet rs --dbpath rs2 --port 37018 --logpath logs\rs2.log --logappend 
start /b mongod --replSet rs --dbpath rs3 --port 37019 --logpath logs\rs3.log --logappend 

* Connect to any one of the Server using mongo shell
mongo --port 37017

* Check the replication status
rs.status()

* Initiate the replication
rs.initiate()

* Check the replication status
rs.status()
rs.isMaster()
rs.conf()

* create one database and collection 
use replica
for(var i=1;i<=1000;i++)db.repltest.insert({empid:i, empname:"Murali"})
db.repltest.find().count()
db.repltest.findOne()

* Add remaining members to the replica set 
rs.add("localhost:37018")
rs.add("localhost:37019")

* Check the replication status
rs.status()
rs.isMaster()
rs.conf()

* Open another command prompt and connect any other server
mongo --port 37018

Try show dbs 
You will not allowed as we are not in Master-Slave config. 

* enable master-slave config 
rs.slaveOk()

Then try the crud operations.

* Repeat the same for the remaining nodes as well.

Replica Set Members:
*************
Priority:
1. The priority settings of replica set members affect both the timing and the outcome of elections for primary. 
2. Higher-priority members are more likely to call elections, and are more likely to win. 
3. Use this setting to ensure that some members are more likely to become primary and that others can never become primary.
4. The value of the member’s priority setting determines the member’s priority in elections. The higher the number, the higher the priority.

The value of priority can be any floating point (i.e. decimal) number between 0 and 1000. 
The default value for the priority field is 1.

To block a member from seeking election as primary, assign it a priority of 0. 
Hidden members and delayed members have priority set to 0.
Non-voting members must have priority of 0.
Members with priority greater than 0 cannot have 0 votes.


Procedure to change the priority settings:
1. Copy the replica set configuration to a variable.
cfg = rs.conf()

2. Change each member’s priority value.
cfg.members[0].priority = 0.5
cfg.members[1].priority = 2
cfg.members[2].priority = 2

3. Reconfigure the replcation
rs.reconfig(cfg)

rs.conf()
Check the status of each members.


*********************************************
Configure Arbiter Replica Set Member
An arbiter does not have a copy of data set and cannot become a primary. 
Replica sets may have arbiters to add a vote in elections for primary. 
rs.addArbiter("XXXX")

********************
Prevent Secondary from Becoming Primary:
Priority - 0 members:

1. cfg = rs.conf()
2. cfg.members[2].priority = 0
3. reconfig(cfg)


A priority 0 member is a member that cannot become primary and cannot trigger elections.
They maintains a copy of the data set, accept read operations, and vote in elections.
Configure a secondary to have priority 0 to prevent it from becoming primary, which is particularly useful in multi-data center deployments.

For example, in the following diagram, one data center hosts the primary and a secondary. A second data center hosts a secondary with priority 0. Only the members in data center 1 can become primary.

********************************************
Hidden Replica Set Members:
A hidden member maintains a copy of the primary’s data set but is invisible to client applications. 
Hidden members are good for workloads with different usage patterns from the other members in the replica set. 
Hidden members must always be priority 0 members and so cannot become primary. 
The db.isMaster() method does not display hidden members. 
Hidden members, however, may vote in elections.


1. cfg = rs.conf()
2. cfg.members[2].priority = 0
3. cfg.members[2].hidden = 0
4. reconfig(cfg)

**********************************************
Delayed Replica set members

The following example sets a 1-hour delay on a secondary member currently at the index 0 in the members array.
cfg = rs.conf()
cfg.members[0].priority = 0
cfg.members[0].hidden = true
cfg.members[0].slaveDelay = 3600
rs.reconfig(cfg)

*********************************************
Configure Non-Voting Replica Set Member
The following example configures the fourth, fifth, and sixth replica set members to be non-voting members.

cfg.members[3].votes = 0;
cfg.members[3].priority = 0;
cfg.members[4].votes = 0
cfg.members[4].priority = 0;
cfg.members[5].votes = 0
cfg.members[5].priority = 0;


***************************************************************************************************************
Oplog:
The oplog (operations log) is a special capped collection that keeps a rolling record of all operations that modify the data stored in your databases. 
MongoDB applies database operations on the primary and then records the operations on the primary’s oplog. 
The secondary members then copy and apply these operations in an asynchronous process. 
All replica set members contain a copy of the oplog, in the local.oplog.rs collection, which allows them to maintain the current state of the database.

****************
Oplog Size
When you start a replica set member for the first time, MongoDB creates an oplog of a default size.

For Unix and Windows systems
The default oplog size depends on the storage engine:

Storage Engine			Default Oplog Size	Lower Bound	Upper Bound
In-Memory Storage Engine	5% of physical memory	50 MB		50 GB
WiredTiger Storage Engine	5% of free disk space	990 MB		50 GB
MMAPv1 Storage Engine		5% of free disk space	990 MB		50 GB


****************
Oplog Status
To view oplog status, including the size and the time range of operations, issue the rs.printReplicationInfo() method
rs.priintReplicationInfo()

use local
db.oplog.rs.stats().maxSize


****************
Change the oplog size of the replica set member
To change the size, run the replSetResizeOplog passing the desired size in megabytes as the size parameter. 
The specified size must be greater than 990, or 990 megabytes.

The following operation changes the oplog size of the replica set member to 2 gigabytes, or 2000 megabytes.

db.adminCommand({replSetResizeOplog: 1, size: 2000})


****************************************************************************************************************

Read Preference
---------------
db.collection.find().readPref( { mode: 'nearest' } )
db.getMongo().setReadPref('primaryPreferred')

primary  - Default mode. All operations read from the current replica set primary.
primaryPreferred - In most situations, operations read from the primary but if it is unavailable, operations
read from secondary members.
secondary - All operations read from the secondary members of the replica set.
secondaryPreferred - In most situations, operations read from secondary members but if no secondary
members are available, operations read from the primary.
nearest - Operations read from member of the replica set with the least network latency,
irrespective of the member’s type.
